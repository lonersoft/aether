# 🥚 aether

A simple multiegg that's highly configurable (in my opinion), ~~that's paid~~ all for free and open source!

aether is a multiegg designed to simply server management for hosting providers. Currently, it only supports Minecraft, but more may come soon.

> [!WARNING]  
> aether is still in it's early stages! right now, the Minecraft Proxies option is not assigned to anything, so it doesn't work anymore, and there may be more bugs that I didn't catch! if any bugs occur, please report it via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/amogusreal69/aether/issues/new), thanks! :3

## Features
there's not alot of impressive features, but some of them might be useful such as:
* built-in rules: when enabled, the first boot of a server will show them rules to comply with a confirmation
* set MCJars API Key: track some stats like the total requests, and even block some server software from there!
* forced MOTD: put your hosting name on their server's MOTD! this does not block plugins that interact with the MOTD such as [MiniMOTD](https://modrinth.com/plugin/minimotd) or [AdvancedServerList](https://modrinth.com/plugin/advancedserverlist)

any ideas you may wanna see? [create an issue!](https://github.com/amogusreal69/aether/issues/new)

## Installation
1. get the egg [here](https://github.com/amogusreal69/aether/blob/main/egg-aether.json) and download the json file
2. navigate to yourpanelurl.com/admin/nests and create a new nest (optional)
3. upload the json file to your newly created nest, or use a existing nest

## Roadmap
right now, this is what i'm planning to do:

- [ ] 💾 decrease docker image size (current is ~250mb)
- [ ] 🤖 maybe setup bot languages? might take alot of space tho
- [ ] ❓ organize the functions of the egg, current egg is kinda hard to understand in my opinion
- [ ] ⌨️ don't make the startup tab filled with admin only variables, maybe like a .json file that people can host themselves?
- [ ] 🔒 lock server softwares that hostings may not need
- [ ] ➕ enable ability to change rules
