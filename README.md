# 🥚 aether

A simple multiegg that's highly configurable (in my opinion), all for free and open source!

aether is a multiegg designed to simply server management for hosting providers. Currently, it only supports Minecraft, but more may come soon.

## Installation

2. navigate to yourpanelurl.com/admin/nests and create a new nest (optional)
3. upload the json file to your newly created nest, or use a existing nest
